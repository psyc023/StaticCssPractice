                <h1>THE OLDMAN AND THE SEA</h1>
                <p>Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy. 
                    But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early in 
                    his dream and went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Islands rising from the sea
                     and then he dreamed of the different harbours and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.</p>
                <p>
                    Where did you wash? the boy thought. The village water supply was two streets down the road.
                     I must have water here for him, the boy thought, and soap and a good towel. Why am I so thoughtless? 
                     I must get him another shirt and a jacket for the winter and some sort of shoes and another blanket.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The boy went out. They had eaten with no light on the table and the old man took off his trousers and went
                     to bed in the dark. He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them. He 
                     rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed.

                    He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boyâ€™s parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.

                    They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was noteangry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.
